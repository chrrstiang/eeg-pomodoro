# 📦 EEG-Powered Pomodoro Timer

- Optimizing deep work with neuroscience 🧠
- Enhance productivity and reduce procrastination 😎


## ℹ️ Overview

This application was built during HackMIT 2025. The pomodoro technique is a strategic way to enhance
productivity, however some people may use the technique the wrong way. Not getting much work done, and letting the timer run out
to convince yourself that you deserve a break.

Through electroencephalogram (EEG) data, we are able to determine how focused a person truly is on the task at hand. By measuring the ratio
of brain waves in the theta range (4-8hz) to the brain waves in the beta range (13-30hz), we can calculate a focus score for the user,
using this to determine whether they should take a break if distracted, or continue working past the timer if they are really focused.

Currently, I have no access to a device capable of collecting **real-time** EEG data, so this demo was built to demonstrate how 
the application will work when collecting real-time EEG data from a user using a CSV file of EEG data.
